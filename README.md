# README
This is source code for my personal github website, no fancy backend, powered by jekyll.

This blog is powered with the [potato-hacker theme](https://github.com/luxedo/jekyll-theme-potato-hacker), kudos to the author for designing such a neat layout.

To build locally:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
Then check out your live site at localhost:4000
