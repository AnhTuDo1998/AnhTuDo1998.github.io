# Linux @ NTU
I am an avid Linux user and sadly the university's support for Linux is the worst. 
Here are some tips and tricks to make your life in NTU easier:
- [Accessing NTU VPN with Linux](https://gist.github.com/pupboss/581fc9eb5c4654637837303eef33e3c3#file-ntuvpn-sh)
- [Microsoft/Adobe Stack with qemu and winapps](https://github.com/Fmstrat/winapps)

  - [Individual Project 1](https://github.com/AnhTuDo1998/CE4042-Assignment1): ANNs and MLPs.
  - [Individual Project 2](https://github.com/AnhTuDo1998/CE4042-Assignment2): CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs...
  - [Group Project](https://github.com/AnhTuDo1998/CE4042-Group): Gender Classification with CNNs (from scratch and pre-trained)

### CX3004 - Multi-Disciplinary Project

### CE3002 - Signals and Control
  - [Lab Project](https://github.com/AnhTuDo1998/CE3002-Signals-Control): A plethysmographic system for monitoring heartbeat.

### CE2007 - Microprocessors (revamped)
  - [Lab source code and handout answers](https://github.com/AnhTuDo1998/CE2007---Microprocessors): A scaled down version of MDP with ARM Cortex-M4 Robot (better than MDP Arduino)

### CE2003 - Digial System Designs

## *MOOCs*
### [MIT CSAIL Missing Semester 2020](missing.csail.mit.edu/)

  - Imo, the best hard-skill course in the universe that any CS students must take. A short course with introduction to computing on Unix such as vim editors, git VCS, command line, debugging and profiling, etc...

  - [Vietnamese version](https://missing-semester-vn.github.io/) available too!

### [LiDAR Obstacle Detection](https://github.com/AnhTuDo1998/Lidar-Obstacle-Detection)
  - Part of coursework for Udacity Sensor Fusion NanoDegree Program.
