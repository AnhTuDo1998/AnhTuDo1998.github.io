# Learning How To Navigate Life
I am Anh Tu, fresh from Saigon, Vietnam. I am 23 years old and a final year student in School of Computer Science and Engineering at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. My interest is technology, food and dancing. Watch this space for my thoughts and update. Peace out!
