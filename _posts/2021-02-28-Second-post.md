Hi there!

Finally having the time to blog again. Must be my third attempt at building a proper personal website...

Anyway, I am currently in year 4 of school now, super stressed out right now. Still can't be sure about what my career should look like and looking at my friends getting good jobs are pushing me to the edge.

I was approached by my professor for part-time job this summer. In return, I asked him for a full-time research assistant. Hope this work out.

Anyhow, recess week is here, better recharge and hope for the best to happen.

Thanks for dropping by. You are precious :)
