Can you all believe it? It's already March, I can't bare the thoughts of graduating really soon, in 2 more months, haha.

Anyway, let me share with you all one of the best MOOC on Earth about computer science (well, sort of) that everyone of us should take part it - [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)

TL;DR: Badass course that teach you how to work with Unix/Linux systems and some trades that software engineers might take a long while to grasp.

Like the name suggest this course visit some pretty stuffs that will make your life as a computer engineering/ computer science easier: Vim editor, Git VCS, Debugger like pdb, gdb, profiler like perf, etc. They even have segments on Bash scripting, data-wrangling with awk, sed, curl, pup, etc. Some very cool stuffs that honestly I wish to have known earlier on, but NTU never covers.

Well juniors and fellow students, don't be like me, if you stumble across my blog and fit the description above, go and get this course in your pocket. You can thank me later.

Thanks for reading!

P/s: If you are a Vietnamese and wish to leverage our national software engineering skillset do join me with doing a translation project for this site. Join me at this [github link](https://github.com/missing-semester-vn/missing-semester-vn.github.io).
